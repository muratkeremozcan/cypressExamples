      Writing tests is an <b>investment</b>, and like any other investment, it
      has to be evaluated in terms of its <b>return</b> and <b>risks</b> (e.g.:{" "}

      You might expect Google to try to build 100% reliable services‚Äîones that
      never fail. It turns out that past a certain point, however, increasing
      reliability is worse for a service (and its users) rather than better!
      Extreme reliability comes at a cost: maximizing stability limits how fast
      new features can be developed and how quickly products can be delivered to
      users, and dramatically increases their cost, which in turn reduces the
      numbers of features a team can afford to offer

      In this essay I want to make the case that{" "}
      <b>prioritizing end-to-end (E2E) testing</b> for the critical parts of

      In addition to integration tests, I want to now make the case that modern

      You might be using the fanciest new compiler, the newest type system, but
      won't do well if, after you ship, your site doesn't load in Chrome at all
      because you forgot to send the right HTTP headers for your{" "}

    <P>
      Modern cloud software has a great deal of complexity that cannot be
      ascertained "in the lab", or by running artificial tests in your computer.
      We normally deploy software to dozens of operating systems, mobile
      devices, web browsers, networks of varying stability and performance‚Ä¶ And
      the environment is always changing, as we take more and more dependencies
      on hosted services and third-party APIs.

      Furthermore, software quality goes beyond correctness. It's not just about
      doing "the right thing".{" "}

      With{" "}

      Just like GitHub is capable of keeping the history of your code forever,
      so can Vercel. Because deploys are{" "}

        <a>stateless</a>
      </Link>
      , the resources are only used on-demand and scale infinitely with traffic.
    </P>

    <P>
      That gets rid of an obvious initial objection: that it would be difficult
      or costly to perform end-to-end tests against a live individualized
      version of your website. Instead of thinking about a single staging server
      that end-to-end tests are run against, now you can have millions of
      concurrent "staging" environments.
    </P>

    <P>
      I say "staging" in quotes because in reality, you run tests against the
      real production infrastructure, which has enormous reliability benefits.

      Having made staging instant, prod-like and cost-effective, the remaining
      objection is that running the actual end-to-end tests would be expensive
      or slow, going by the pyramid above.

      First, I'm going to define an end-to-end test to ascertain that my blog
      always contains the string "Guillermo Rauch" in the browser title. As I'm
      writing this, it's not the case, so I expect this to fail.

    <P>
      Checkly gives me full access to the Node and puppeteer APIs. Notice I
      don't have to write any ceremony, setup or scheduling logic. I'm "inside"
