## Sample repo for Mailosaur tests with Cypress

We are using an open email `cypress-mailosaur-test@protonmail.com` with pw `Password-1`. Login at [](https://mailosaur.com/app/).

`cypress.env.json` is shared.

This is so that things can work out of the box without any setup. We trust the community to put it to good use.

`npm i`

`npm run cypress:open`
